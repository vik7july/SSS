//	Regression Testing because when problem identified and fixed it is testing. Reg test verfiy that because of that fix
/*	But, the main difference between an abstract class and interface in Java 8 is the fact that an abstract class is a class and an interface is an interface.

	A class can have a state which can be modified by non-abstract methods but an interface cannot have the state because they can't have instance variables.

	The second difference is that an interface cannot have a constructor even in Java 8 but you may remember that abstract class can also have a constructor in Java.

	All methods of an interface were abstract but since Java 8 you can define non-abstract methods in form of default and static methods inside interface in Java.

TestNG from Command Prompt
After adding TestNG to your project library create one folder in your Project names as lib ( name can be anything ) :

Go to "C:\Program Files\Eclipse\eclipse-java-mars-R-win32-x86_64\eclipse\plugins" location and copy com.beust.jcommander_1.72.0.jar and org.testng_6.14.2.r20180216145.jar file to created folder (lib).

Note : Files are testng.jar and jcommander.jar

Now Launch CMD, and navigate to your project directory and then type :
Java -cp C:\Users\User123\TestNG\lib*;C:\Users\User123\TestNG\bin org.testng.TestNG testng.xml

 * public class ArrayVsList { Array is collection of homogeneous elements. List
 * is collection of heterogeneous elements.
 * 
 * For Array memory allocated is static and continuous. For List memory
 * allocated is dynamic and Random.
 * 
 * Array: User need not have to keep in track of next memory allocation. List:
 * User has to keep in Track of next location where memory is allocated.
 * 
 * In general (and in Java) an array is a data structure generally consisting of
 * sequential memory storing a collection of objects.
 * 
 * List is an interface in Java, which means that it may have multiple
 * implementations. One of these implementations is ArrayList, which is a class
 * that implements the behavior of the List interface using arrays as the data
 * structure.
 * 
 * 
 * The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to
 * store local variables and function call while heap memory is used to store
 * objects in Java. ... 5) Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the
 * owner Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread.
 * 
 * Variables allocated on the stack are stored directly to the memory and access
 * to this memory is very fast, and it's allocation is dealt with when the
 * program is compiled. ... The basic difference between stack and heap is that
 * stack is used static memory location whereas heap is used for dynamic memory
 * allocation.}
